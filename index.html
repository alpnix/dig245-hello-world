        <li>I'm Alp Niksarli, class of 2027 and I want to major in computer science.</li>
        <li>I have always been interested in web development and I have recently started being interested in design by using software. So, this class felt like a perfect fit for me.</li>
        <li>I have intermediate experience with basic front-end tools like HTML, CSS, JS, or Bootstrap. I have also used backend tools like Node.js or Django/Flask in Python before.</li>
        <li>I want to be able to create prettier websites with the design skills I get from this class. </li>
        <li>The command line tutorial was the most useful in my opinion as I view the topic as one of the most fundamental topics to the entire web development and coding scope. With this tutorial, one could learn how to change directories, create files or simply do almost anything you would be able to do from a file explorer interface with the help of a command line. Which get extremely handy when you're working on a project virtually or with many files. </li>

                    <b>Title:</b> Google Will Eat Itself

                    <p>I really like this website because of its simplicity and how it's able to fit in many content without being caothic. The use of images also makes it easier to go through the content.</p>

                    <p>Even though this looked like a senseless game at first, after reading more about it, I realized it was older than a decade which existed in the first days of Facebook. Even now, I believe it's a great way to measure people's interest in the different types of games.</p>

                    <p>I loved the idea about this website. It lets you get to know about the people around you or in the internet. In terms of design, all the scrollable content was on the right with images which was quite appealing to the eye.</p>
